# Guess Number Game

## introduction
This is a simple HTML, CSS, and javaScript online game. The game operates by asking the user to estimate a randomly selected number. As you give guesses, it will tell you whether to go lower or higher until you obtain the correct number. It gives you a score based on how many times you picked the correct number.
